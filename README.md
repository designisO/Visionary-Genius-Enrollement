# Visionary Genius Enrollement
In this project I was able to create a form within Bootstrap that allows users to add, delete and edit students who enroll. The goal was to review front end development as well as CRUD operations. CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) knowledge is essential in web and software developement allowing users to manipulate data. 

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap
